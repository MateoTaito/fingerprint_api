- **Error Condition Testing**: Validates proper error handling
- **Integration Testing**: End-to-end workflow testing

### Documentation
- **API Documentation**: Complete endpoint documentation in `API_ENDPOINTS.md`
- **Postman Collection**: Ready-to-use Postman collection for testing
- **Example Responses**: Detailed JSON examples for all endpoints

## üöÄ Performance Optimizations

### Smart Verification
- **Single-scan Identification**: Capture fingerprint once, identify any user
- **Intelligent Fallback**: Optimized performance across different environments
- **Accurate Statistics**: Real-time fingerprint counting and user statistics

### System Monitoring
- **Real-time Updates**: Fingerprint counts update automatically
- **System Health**: Comprehensive status monitoring
- **Usage Analytics**: Track system usage patterns over time
